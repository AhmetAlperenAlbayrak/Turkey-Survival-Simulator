# Turkey-Survival-Simulator
Hello There,

As you may be heard of, there are difficult times in Turkey right now. And it would lead anyone in Turkey to a deep depression.

I do not like to give my hopes and fall in to a hole. So I set a goal for me, and it is to become  a software developer.

I did a lot of research about it. I was always the guy who first learns how to learn.

So in general, Python was suggested by everyone because it was easy to learn. So I started to learn python step by step.

I complete the procedural programming phase.

To test what I have learned, I made this simple program.

It has one issue, I will mention it later here.

Thank you
